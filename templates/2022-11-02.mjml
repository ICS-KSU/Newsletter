                   <p> <i>Learn about the history of games</i> in HIST 301B
                   (speaking of enrollment...). Here's the course description:
                   <blockquote>This class is about history in games. The goal
                       is to think more carefully about the meanings of the
                       games we play and about what these games mean for our
                       historical consciousness today. Students will
                       investigate selected games in depth, and will also work
                       toward designing their own historical games. For
                       questions about this class contact Professor Brandom,
                       <a href="mailto:ebrandom@ksu.edu">ebrandom@ksu.edu</a>.</blockquote>
