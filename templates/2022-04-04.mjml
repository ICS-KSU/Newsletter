                        quickly, so if you haven't yet made a pre-enrollment
                        appointment with Elli, <a href="https://k-state.navigate.eab.com/app/"> 
                        click here</a> to schedule one now using the Navigate
                        website. You can still choose between in-person or
                        virtual appointments, so it should be easy to schedule
                        a time!
