                    <p>
                        ICS got a new newsletter! We were getting a little
                        tired of attaching fliers to your emails. So, with the 
                        magic of <a href="https://mjml.io">mjml</a> 
                        (there's never a bad time to learn a new XML dialect)
                        we've created a new responsive email template! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also got <a href="https://github.com/ICS-KSU">a
                        new github organization</a>! If you want to take a peek
                        behind the scenes, check it out. In the future, we want
                        to use the ICS organization to host and advertise
                        student projects. So if you'd like to join, and start
                        using ICS to publically host some code you're proud of,
                        please let us know.
                    </p>

                        Ever wonder if you're living in a video game?

                        According to philosopher C. Thi Nguyen, you definitely
                        areâ€”just not in the way you think. Nguyen gave
                        a fascinating interview about the philosophy of gaming
                        this week on the Ezra Klein Show, on that question
                        and a lot more.
