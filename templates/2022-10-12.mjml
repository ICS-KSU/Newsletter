                   <h3>In the News</h3>
                   <p> Have you heard that the US has put out a 
                       <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf">"Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights"</a>? 
                       But, not rights for robots - rights for
                       humans who are impacted by the applications of big data
                       methods powered by AI. The Blueprint supports five principles:
                       <ol>
                           <li>You should be protected from unsafe or ineffective
                               systems.</li>
                           <li>You should not face discrimination by algorithms
                               and systems should be used and designed in an
                               equitable way.</li>
                           <li>You should be protected from abusive data practices via built-in protections and you
                               should have agency over how data about you is used.</li>
                           <li>You should know that an automated system is being used and understand how and why it
                               contributes to outcomes that impact you.</li>
                           <li>You should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly
                               consider and remedy problems you encounter.</li>
                       </ol>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Sounds pretty good, but raises some hard questions. What
                       does it mean to say that an algorithm is discriminatory?
                       When is it appropriate to be able to opt out of AI-powered
                       data collection? Sounds like something an ICS major might be
                       able to figure out...
