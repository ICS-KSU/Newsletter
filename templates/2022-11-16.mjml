                       a project from OpenAI that converts descriptions into

                   <p>The hackathon is behind us (hope you enjoyed it!) and now

                   <h3>In the News:</h3>
                   <p> It was bound to happen eventually - someone has
                       copyrighted an original work of art generated using AI
                       text-to-image methods. The work is “Zarya of the Dawn”,
                       a comic book whose illustrations were generated using
                       Midjounrny AI.
                   </p>
                   <p> Whatever comes of this—if the copyright claim is upheld
                       or overturned—it's going to be pretty important for the
                       future of AI-powered artistic creation. For more
